# [20 patterns in software teams](https://resources.gitprime.com/books/20-patterns/)

_These are just my summary bullets, the book itself isn't too long and is well designed - worth a proper read!_

For managers looking to "debug" team processes / ways of working. This is a collection of behaviours that can happen and (hopefully) how to address them.

## Individual Patterns:

### Domain Champion

Works in one area, knows it best. 
Good in the sort term: they work fast, not often blocked.
Bad in the long term: Low bus factor, low engagement in code reviews, risk of attrition.

Try assigning low risk small tasks outside their domain. 
Ask them who else would benefit from having tasks within their domain assigned.
Attempt to inch them into more diverse domains.

### Hoarding the Code

Doesn't share work in progress, submits big polished Pull Requests (frequently, this happens to everyone occasionally).
Misses collaboration opportunities, the larger the code to review the lower the review quality.
Harder to accept review feedback given the amount of work already committed.

Be compassionate - they're likely tired from delivering a big chunk of work.
