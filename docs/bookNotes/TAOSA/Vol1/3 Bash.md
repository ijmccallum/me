## 3. [BASH](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) the Bourne Again SHell

I'd bet you're familiar with it. It's a language unto itself! With reserved words (`if`, `while`, `for`), operators (`|`, `>`), variables (strings, integers, arrays (indexed or associative, of strings or integers - not other arrays)), and more. Input comes from the keyboard or scripts then is run through a pipeline: "Input Processing" - built on top of [readline](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html) which handles the command line editing. "Parsing" - splits a stream of characters into words and applying meaning. Lots of intricacies there. "Word Expansion" - Applys variables, expands a lot of utility like mini functions (my words!). eg `pre{one,two,three}post` to `preonepost pretwopost prethreepost`. And a lot more. There's some overlap in responsability between this and Parsing. "Command Execution" - usually a command name passed to the OS with a list of arguments. But also the meat of the Bash programming language.

_This one was a streatch for me to understand. But the final section on "lessons learned" was clear enough: keep detailed change logs, have extensive regression testing built in, standards are good if you can have them, keep good detailed documentation, find and use good software to help._
