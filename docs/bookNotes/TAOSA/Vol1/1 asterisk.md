A Multi format, extensible phone server. Allows communication between many phone technologies (VoIP, Old school, and more I'm sure). Also allows 'dialplans' - applications whos UI is essentially your phone call. EG automated answering giving you options in a phone menu, I'm guessing robo calls too. An incoming phone call is recieved by Asterisk, the type of tech is checked and a module for translating the tech specicif connection into a generic connection is assigned. The newly translated generic connection is then hooked up to an `ast_channel` - an object that will run the dialplan within Asterisk. That dialplan could be a phone menu or it could request a connection to another phone (which would run another connection but from generic to tech specific). If the outbound call tech matches the in bound, a direct connection may be initiated to save on translation into and out of the generic channel type.

_The examples are a bit hard to decipher (written in C, which I'm not familiar with), but there are loads of details in the article which clarify things. Specifically the abstraction from connection tech to a general internal connection - that process will probably stick in my head for a good long while, so much simpler and clear than I would have guessed for a phone system like this!_
