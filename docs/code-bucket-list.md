## Project Ideas

- [x] Make a [Static site generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mini-site-generator) just using js template strings.
- [ ] Life dashboard. Something to keep track of life goals, things you're doing towards those life goals. Also long term things to be aware of. A todo list that fades over time. Aknowledge that things change. Could be Federated, don't want it tied to one device - though it could be.
- [ ] Betes tracker: list foods you eat, rough in blood sugar graphs & insulin. Multiple users to aggregate data for speed of relative digestion / relative impact... in progress!
- [ ] npm link visualiser (& docker containers?)
- [ ] Garden management app - list flowers / timeline for caring
- [ ] Boat picks sharing web app thing... dad's idea
- [ ] Library sharer - unless a good one exists already
- [ ] Whisky Tracker: point tracking - one on one ...
- [ ] Get to know / write up Karp's 21 NP-complete problems
- [ ] css classic posters / graphic design
- [ ] Task wars / market: pay 'money' to assign tasks - more for a higher priority / ahead in the queue. Price adjusts depending on individual queues.
- [ ] Chrome extension: color the background of tabs based on url keywords (eg, "localhost" : dark grey, "staging": red, etc)
- [x] [Console Madness](https://github.com/ijmccallum/consoleMadness): makes it look like you are doing something phenominal but you're just typing randomly
- [ ] Javascript your Genome: http://genomejs.readme.io/docs/what-do-i-do - 1st get my genome sequenced, then do things with the data!
- [x] random: map out [google location history](https://codeburst.io/how-i-created-a-heatmap-of-my-location-history-with-javascript-google-maps-972a2d1be240)... wow that's a bit scary - really obvious where we've lived!
- [ ] [WikiLogic](https://github.com/WikiLogic/WikiLogic): in progress!
- [ ] Build some kind of map / plan thing with [WRLD](https://www.wrld3d.com/) here's a [tutorial](https://www.sitepoint.com/building-dynamic-3d-maps/). To link in with Westport & Co possibly.
- [ ] Build a learning demo that explains graphically how Molecules, atoms, sub atomic particles, fermions / bosons / spin etc works.
- [ ] Open Source P2P social network, this must exist already: something that does not connect to a central server & can communicate over wifi / bluetooth / any other available means... built on [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/)
- [ ] npm module to ping a server every time you do a build in order to track who has a project set up and how long it's been since they worked on it. (would be an internal tool for agencies, no so much open source). Could include data like file sizes etc.

## Articles to write

- [ ] Translate [elegant-error-handling](https://jrsinclair.com/articles/2019/elegant-error-handling-with-the-js-either-monad/) into my own words

## Articles to read

* [x] https://engineering.instagram.com/search-architecture-eeb34a936d3a Quick overview of instagrams search process -mentions a few technologies but they seem facebook specific.
* [x] https://foundation.nodejs.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/50/2017/09/Nodejs-at-Uber.pdf Quick overview of the scale that Uber is using Node at. Node marketing!



## 30 Day Challenges

Every day for a month look up & do a quick write up of any thing related to one of these topics.

- [x] MDN
- [ ] Node
- [ ] Go
- [ ] d3.js

## Reading list

- [ ] Google's site reliability engineering book
- [ ] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL6SouuO0_k rewatch and work up my own example. Possibly use in WL
- [ ] https://github.com/Developer-Y/Scalable-Software-Architecture
- [ ] http://aosabook.org/en/index.html
- [ ] https://github.com/mojoaxel/awesome-regression-testing#online-services

- [ ] probabilistic reasoning in intelligent systems networks of plausible inference
- [ ] causality models reasoning and inference
- [x] https://engineering.instagram.com/search-architecture-eeb34a936d3a Quick overview of instagrams search process -mentiones a few technologies but they seem facebook specific.
- [x] https://foundation.nodejs.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/50/2017/09/Nodejs-at-Uber.pdf Quick overview of the scale that Uber is useing Node at. Node marketing!
- [ ] [The Architecture of Open Source Applications](http://aosabook.org/en/index.html) Vol 1

  - [ ]
- [Functional-Light-JS](https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS) A deep run through of basic functional programming for JavaScript. It also helps solidify an understanding of JS, particularly scopes and closures. And it has an amazing line saying that immutable variables "reduce the surface area of surprise". Love that!
- [The Architecture of Open Source Applications](http://aosabook.org/en/index.html) In depth overviews / critiques of the system designs behind some great open source projects.
