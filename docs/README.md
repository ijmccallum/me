# 🧑‍💻

Hi, I'm a Web Developer / Software Engineer (although recently I think the term "code gardener" has become more appropriate given I've spent the past few years working around the old code and ancient systems of a fairly gigantic financial enterprise).

What I do: "Digital Transformation", or in human speak: I take old, aging, manual, or even non-existant business processes (99% of the time this means "a form") and automate them with Internet Magic. And in using "I" there, I'm actually meaning "we". "We" being the team I'm working with at any given time. I do not envy the person who takes on enterprise changes alone. The difference a great team at your back makes is \<insert the most inspirational word/phrase/quote you know here\>.

How to find me: I'm always open to talking over new opportunities - my email's probably the best way to get me, or [twitter](https://twitter.com/ijmccallum). I check [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iainjmccallum) _very_ occasionally (my email is listed under my contact info there). I'm also on [Github](https://github.com/ijmccallum), [Goodreads](http://goodreads.com/iainiain), WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Facebook, Discord, Teams, Slack, Steam, and half a million other apps. By-the-by, I do also have a physical mailing address. Would be nice to get a hand written hello one of these days, if you're up for a challenge!

And Now for Something Completely Different

```js
function stop(whatTime) {
  if (whatTime == "hammer time") {
    console.log(`duuu du du du      du du      du du`);
  }
}

stop("hammer time");
```
