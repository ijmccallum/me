# Quick App prototyping / bootstrapping

Trying to figure out the best way to kickstart an app when a new idea rolls around.

_You can see how this is a hard thing to google_

* Auth - signup, login. (password recovery would be an awesome bonus!)
* Testing (Jest)
* Modern JS
* API

## Node API frameworks / starters:

[KeystoneJS](http://keystonejs.com/) -

[SailsJS](https://sailsjs.com/) - has a starter that includes auth / password recovery. Apparently start up time takes a bit as a project grows, not too bad. Bit of a learning curve to figure out their way of doing things. Older JS, runs on grunt.

[TrailsJS](https://trailsjs.io/) - more modern than sails. Doesn't seem to have the same starter.

[ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)

[Koa](http://koajs.com/)
