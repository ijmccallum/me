# Learning Cobol

Am I mad? :D Just curious.

---

 - [ ] Starter project, cobol program to read json and convert it into cobol? har har har
 - [ ] Document the fundamentals / map between cobol to JS
 - [ ] Find an existing codebase to look through

Install cobol `brew install gnu-cobol`
Check it worked `cobc -v`

In VS Code I went for the `Z Open Editor` for syntax highlighting (and more by the looks of it!)

Compile the program: `cobc -x helloworld.cob`
Run the program `./helloworld`
