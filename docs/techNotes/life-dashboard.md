# Life Goaling

## Service Design (my style)

### Discover / research / notes on life goaling / brain dump
Why we life goal: to get more out of life
How do we life goal: random ideas / someone else does something cool, the media informs us of things we should be doing.
Feels like self imposed stress a lot of the time, especially when we're aware of not achieveing 
Do it to show off to a certain extent (isn't this why people post to instagram etc?)
Do it with the aspiration of contentedness / good feelings
Write down a goal. Might write down how to go after that goal. Some might use a framework to help, eg Kata (or me right now using SD).
If a thing isn't fun on the way, we easily let it slide / forget about it / do something else more interesting. Hard to catch ourselves / know how much time we're letting slide.
Might get distracted by a shiny thing that is actually better. the new shiny thing might be the right thing to do but all our work onto the old thing now feels a waste, it's painful.
The goal might be a habit we intend to do for ever (a while), maybe not a thing that can be "finished".
"Finishing" does not feature heavily in life goals... but we want it to.
Support from friends / strangers would probably help a lot... especially from people with the same goal. Do we ever search those people out?
Skill / Habit / achievement
Flight of fancy - is it worth it.
 
### Timeline / forking map of things going wrong 
The Idea
  - flash of inspiration, hype, excitment
  - group chat, group hype, energy from the people
  - slow boil, back of the mind.
  - An idea friend might come back to time and time again.
The Toe Dip (a first attempt at starting)
  - Research 
    - Get put off because it's been done / seems too hard / too expensive
    - looks doable, the energy continues
  - Dive head first, buy stuff, begin without a plan
  - Write down a todo list
The First Hurdle (will it continue or is it a flash in the pan?) (Repeat, repeat, repeat)
  - Distraction arrives / another time challenge / a temptation / a reconsideration - maybe a better shiny thing arrives
    - Hold fast on the goal / return within a short span of time
    - distraction wins, you don't return to the idea
Feels like it never ends

### Life goaling Problem -> HMW -> Idea
  - The flash in the pan dissapates: it feels like a lost opportunity - you didn't even try.
    - **HMW make the feeling of saying no feel like the _right_ thing to do.**
      - Visualise the effort from a total rough guesstimate 
        - Graph it with a shadowed tripling / grades of increasing to make up for how bad we are at estimating
        - enumerate the effort in different ways, eg hours per week & how long it would take to show the opportunity cost
        - provide context against other life things like another degree / learning a language / an extra hour a day sleeping / exercise
      - Pass on the love, print out the idea in postcard format and mail it to a random address / penpal addresses? different langage? / club somewhere?
  - The research stage makes your idea crumble: a feeling of unsureness as to what to do next, a feeling of loss.
    - **HMW make the crumbling of a once invigorating idea feel like a win.**
      - Get reasurance from others, postcard idea / email export with a standard bit of text saying "I've decided against doing this - do you think that's the right thing to do?"
  - You've found an idea that looks awesome but would take more resources than you're willing to commit.
    - **HMW give that idea time & make it pop up again when you have the resources?**
      - export the idea in a calendar format for you to add to whatever calendar you use (that will probably outlast whatever this turns out to be)
        - make it pop up on the lead up to holidays at increasing intervals
      - give you a print out of the idea in a concise format for you to hide somewhere for your future self.
    - **HMW turn the idea in a way that it till take no resources**
      - provide links to other prototyping lists / orijects
      - Provide a list of prototyping techniques in a way that lets you identify the most appropriate (which is better, this or that? Like a league of prototyping techniques, not just pick from the list, order the list. Add more if you wish, but the top one in this list is this idea's best hope.)
  - Dove straight in, but it faded, and now you have resources no longer valued to you
    - **HMW rescue wasted resources?**
      - Just sell the thing! On ebay? Make it mad somehow
      - Connect with other life goalers / people looking to do the same kind of thing?
      - Donate to some kind of school / charity / club / group. Provides a way in for you to connect with people
    - **HMW turn the waste into a feeling of gain**
    - **HMW spot potentially wastable resources before we spend on them**
      - provide a visualisation (like the ideas mentioned way above) against the cost/effort you're looking to spend, ROI in a less businessy way
      - Check list before you spend on the thibgs - is it possible to sell / donate / reuse the thing? (if reusing, how, detail it out)
  - Got distracted / faded on the idea because we couldn't bring ourselves to continue pushing. (but it still feels like the idea has legs)
    - **HMW give the project a feeling of weight & responsability that would pull you out of your stuper - create pressure like a job**
      - Give the project a personality, like the tamagichies of time gone by
      - Make you "register" with a friend, don't allow you to close the project without that person agreeing.
  - Continued pushing but feels like it's going nowhere / like time & effort is a wasting
    - **HMW reignite the original spark of joy that began you on this path for this idea**
      - record yourself in the initial throws of excitment so you can replay it at this stage.
    - **HMW reinvigorate this idea**
      - see the postcard / email / send this idea on to someone else. Pass it on to give it new life. Idea donation.
    - **HMW visualise the field of ideas competeing for your time and see who's winning.**
      - see previous idea about the field of ideasw competing for your time
