# WordPress

For me this was the beginning of my development (after the preamble that was the [Stanford Java course](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS106A)). As a freelance Graphic Designer I didn't really know what I was doing code wise, but I'd still build you a website! I doubt I'll ever go back to good old WP - if you're looking to set up a site now, I'd just say go sign up for SquareSpace or which ever platform is the easiest, simplest, DIY website builder that'll do everything for you. Life's not long enough to build your own. Thanks WordPress! And goodbye.
