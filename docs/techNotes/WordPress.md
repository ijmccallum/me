# WordPress

WordPress was a big part of my start in development, actually it was _the_ start of it - freelance Graphic Designer / "Web Developer"! I'd build you a website with it even though I had _no idea_ what I was doing! Served me well, a stepping stone into the digital agency world churning out site after site at crazy speed. TDD? Bwahaha. WP you served me well, I may return, but for now fare thee well.
