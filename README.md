Built with vuepress

 - `npm i`
 - `npm run dev` to run it locally (look in the "docs" folder)
 - `npm run build` to build the vuepress dist
 - `npm run deploy` to deploy the built files! (might need to be done manually)

To add a new page:

 - create a page in `./docs` somewhere
 - add it to `./docs/.vuepress/config.js`

./src is the old version. need to pull some of that into the new one.
